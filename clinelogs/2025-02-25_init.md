# 2025-02-25 Project Initialization Log

## Initial Planning

### Project Structure Decision
- Decided to name the project "Knowledge Hub"
- Chose a modular architecture separating frontend, backend, and infrastructure
- Planned for Docker-based development environment
- Created base project structure with documentation

### Technology Stack Rationale

#### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
  - Latest features and improved performance
  - Better SEO capabilities
  - Improved developer experience
  - Built-in TypeScript support
- ESLint & Prettier
  - Consistent code style
  - Early error detection
  - Automated formatting

#### Backend
- Go/Echo
  - High performance
  - Strong typing
  - Excellent concurrency support
  - Simple and clean API design
- OpenAPI 3.1
  - API-first development
  - Automated documentation
